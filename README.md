# authsrv
A jwt authentication server in Go

## Warning
This is a personal project I wrote to help myself learn about Go web development as well as authentication via JWT.

I don't recommend using this as-is in production, but maybe it can offer you some insights into your project.

## To-Do
- [x] Add refresh JWT tokens
- [ ] User management
- [-] Tests
- [-] Kubernetes resources
- [x] Use gorilla/mux
- [ ] Metrics via Prometheus
- [ ] CI/CD
- [ ] Utilize Go modules (Waiting for Fedora 29 w/ go1.11)
